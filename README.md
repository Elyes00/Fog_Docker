# Fog_Docker
This project is made to design a fog solution based on containers.

We are connecting and arduino uno with Raspberry pi B+ in UART mode to get data from arduino into raspi pi with our python code .
the python code also contains some other implementation of the UBIDOTS code to get a real time sharts for our sensors.

the docker tech is used to build a powerful microservices connections between independent services.

You can read more about my project in the PDF document.
